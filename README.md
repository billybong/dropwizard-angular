dropwizard-angular
==================

Silly project for playing around with a simple CRUD app using Dropwizard and AngularJS
Bundled as an application using Gradle install plugin.

Simply run "gradlew installApp" to build. You dont need either Maven or Gradle to build, just Java.
Then start with:

cd /build/install/dropwizard-angular/bin/
dropwizard-angular server ../conf/config.yml
